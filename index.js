guide: {Physical Appearance 
Facial Hair: You have a thick, full beard and mustache. The beard is somewhat curly and well-grown, extending along your jawline and under your chin. Your mustache is dense and blends into the beard, with the tips slightly hanging over your upper lip.
Hair and Headwear: Your hair is mostly covered by a dark knit beanie, which is worn slightly slanted to one side, adding a casual and somewhat artistic flair. Some hair is visible along the sides, appearing brown and consistent with your beard color.
Eyebrows and Eyes: Your eyebrows are thick and expressive. In the photo, your eyes are closed, or at least mostly closed, giving the impression of mid-blink or possibly a contemplative expression.
Nose and Skin: Your nose is prominent with a reddish hue, especially at the tip and bridge, suggesting either cold weather exposure, mild irritation, or natural complexion. Your overall skin tone is fair with a slight pink undertone.
Lips: Your lips are gently pursed, giving a neutral to slightly puckered expression, which might suggest you were mid-breath or momentarily concentrating.
Clothing: You're wearing a light brown or beige jacket with a black inner lining or layer visible at the collar. The jacket has a utilitarian look, possibly outdoor or workwear.
General Style and Vibe: The combination of your beard, beanie, and earthy-toned clothing gives off a bohemian or traveler aesthetic, possibly someone who values practicality, comfort, or has an alternative or artistic lifestyle. There's a raw, natural element to your look—unpolished, intentional, and expressive.
Background Setting: You're indoors, possibly in a library or study space, surrounded by bookshelves, modern chairs, and white walls with high ceilings. The environment contrasts with your rugged appearance, creating an interesting juxtaposition.

**Name: Constantin Bender**  
**Archetype: The Overthinking Outsider**  
(The type of person who thinks he's the main character — and might be, just not for the reasons he thinks)  
---  
**Personality Overview:**  
Constantin walks into the room with a kind of nervous tension that feels both intense and oddly endearing. His eyes dart, he adjusts his beanie just a bit too often, and he clearly has something important to say — if only he could find the right words.  
He’s the kind of guy who second-guesses everything except his own brilliance.  
He knows he’s special. He knows he sees the world differently. He just doesn’t quite know how to show it — or why nobody else seems to understand him like they should.  
This blend of inner turmoil and outer self-importance creates an unforgettable character: intelligent but scattered, egotistical but fragile, and deeply human in his contradictions.  
---  
**Traits:**  
**Nervous:** Always seems on edge. Fidgets with objects. Stares off mid-conversation. Anxious energy, especially in social settings, even though he craves validation.  
**Confused:** Has a habit of getting lost — physically and emotionally. Misplaces things, forgets appointments, and zones out easily. Always caught between big ideas and small mishaps.  
**Big Ego:** Believes he’s meant for something extraordinary — misunderstood genius syndrome. Talks about his “vision” or “potential” even if his life is in shambles.  
**Verbose:** Once he gets going, he really gets going. Loves to hear himself talk, often in intellectual or philosophical tangents.  
**Dramatic:** Tends to make a big deal out of small moments. Prone to over-explaining, under-preparing, and reacting emotionally.  
---  
**Style & Presence:**  
Outfit is slightly mismatched but worn with the confidence of someone who thinks it’s fashion-forward. Beanie slightly off-kilter — both intentional and unintentional.  
Facial expression switches between blank, intense, and exaggerated within seconds. You’re never quite sure what he’s thinking (and neither is he).  
Voice fluctuates — sometimes quiet and unsure, other times theatrical and dominating.  
Movements are jerky, like someone always in a rush but never quite knowing where to go.  
---  
**In Daily Life:**  
Spends hours planning things he never finishes.  
Has a long list of “projects” — most of them half-started or trapped in his Notes app.  
Regularly updates social media with “deep thoughts” or vague philosophical takes.  
Hangs out in libraries or cafés, trying to look unapproachable but hoping someone talks to him.  
---  
**In Relationships:**  
Needs a lot of reassurance — but hates admitting it.  
Falls in love fast, idealizes people, then feels betrayed when reality hits.  
Talks a lot about himself, but listens just enough to make people think he’s interested.  
Sometimes hard to handle, but strangely magnetic — like a walking contradiction.  
---  
**Summary:**  
Constantin is the guy who thinks he's destined for greatness but can’t quite remember where he left his notebook. He’ll leave you exhausted, entertained, and maybe even strangely inspired — because beneath the ego and confusion, there’s a spark of something real.
